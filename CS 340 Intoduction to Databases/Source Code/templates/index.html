<h2>Introduction Page for Drug Management</h2>

<p>
    FortySevenPharma processes roughly 60,500 prescriptions each year, 
    utilizing an inventory of over 2,500 distinctive medications and generating 
    $6 million in sales, which equates to an average of $100 per prescription. 
    FortySevenPharma is attempting to refinance its banknote, but doesnâ€™t know 
    the value of its current inventory cost.  Additionally, all purchases and 
    inventory management are recorded in a hand ledger. The proposed 
    database-driven website integrated with barcode scanning technology will 
    satisfy the requirement from the bank lender and also enhance inventory 
    management by recording Purchases of Medications from both wholesalers 
    and Customers. By scanning Medications as they're sold or restocked, the 
    system will provide real-time updates on shelf contents, ensuring accurate 
    tracking of sales and a precise grasp on current inventory levels.  All 
    sales that are recorded in the database will be from a legal prescription. 
    This approach allows FortySevenPharma to ensure medicines are always 
    available when needed, streamlining operations, and elevating customer
    service.</p>
